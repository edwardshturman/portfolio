        <h2>📚  EDUCATION</h2>
        <p>
          As a graduating high school student from the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/design-tech-high-school/">Ultimate Incubator</a>, a High School Fellow at Stanford University, and a Computer Science Major at USF, I enjoy employing design thinking when solving problems. This philosophy has helped in many of my projects in education, including fundraising $35K to build a school in Nepal, researching social robotics in AI with the Stanford Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Education (AIRE) Lab, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I grow in my college career, I'm excited to learn more about problems I come across for me, my friends, my school, and my community, and what I want to do to solve them.

        <h2>🌟  PROJECTS</h2>

        <p>
          From my open-source work, check out <a href="https://edwardshturman.com/register">Register</a>: a high-quality Discord bot for event planning. Or, another Discord bot, <a href="https://edwardshturman.com/rollup">Rollup</a>, for keeping clean channels using threading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some cool, yet-to-be-announced projects I'm working on include a game-changing security feature for Discord, and an educational/corporate accountability tool, allowing admins to better communicate with their students + staff on policy changes. Taking feedback empowers these groups in their self-advocacy, an important skill in the 21st century.
