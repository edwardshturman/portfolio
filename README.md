> An experimental and creative attempt at a portfolio using 3D rendering.

Tech stack:
- TypeScript;
- Node.js // Express;
- Three.js; and
- Heroku.

This was a fun experiment with TypeScript, stepping out of my plain ol' JavaScript comfort zone, and I look forward to testing around with more JS libraries!

*Built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D models.*
